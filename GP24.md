# Guided Practice 24: Investigation 31

## Preview

We continue on with our investigation of The Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups. How is it "fundamental", and what does it let us do?
 
## Reading

Read all of Investigation 31. 

## Learning Objectives 

The Concept Check quiz will be from objectives __CC.23__ and __CC.24__. Come prepared to do the following:


+ CC.23: State and instantiate the definitions of the following terms: p-group; p-primary component of a group; 
+ CC.24: State the following mathematical results: Theorem 31.3; Corollary 31.6; Theorem 31.13 (Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups)

## Reading questions

During your reading or afterwards, answer the following questions. These will be graded on a scale of 0 to 1 on the basis of completeness and effort only. You should give a good-faith effort to answer each exercise and be right in your answer, but if you make a mathematical or conceptual mistake it will not count against you. However, if you leave an item blank, put “I don’t know”, or similarly do not put forth an effort to answer each question, you will lose credit. Be sure to come to class prepared to share your answers and to lead a discussion on these problems.
