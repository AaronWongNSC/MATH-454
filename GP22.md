# Guided Practice 22: Investigation 31

## Preview

The Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups determines the structure of any finite abelian group up to isomorphism. This allows us to classify each finite abelian group as a product of cyclic groups (of prime power order).

## Learning Objectives 

The Concept Check quiz will be from objectives  __CC.21__ and __CC.22__. The new material will come from objectives __CC.23__ and __CC.24__. Come prepared to do the following:

+ CC.21: State and instantiate the definitions of the following terms: Homomorphism of groups; epimorphism; monomorphism; homomorphic image; kernel of a homomorphism; image of a homomorphism
+ CC.22: State the following mathematical results: Theorem 30.4; Theorem 30.8; Theorem 30.13 (The First Isomorphism Theorem); Theorem 30.16 (The Second Isomorphism Theorem); Theorem 30.18 (The Third Isomorphism Theorem); Theorem 30.19 (The Fourth Isomorphism Theorem); Theorem 30.22
+ (CORE) M.24: Determine whether a function between two groups is a homomorphism (epimorphism, monomorphism). 
+ (CORE) M.25: Determine the kernel and image of a homomorphism. 
+ CC.23: State and instantiate the definitions of the following terms: p-group; p-primary component of a group; 
+ CC.24: State the following mathematical results: Theorem 31.3; Corollary 31.6; Theorem 31.13 (Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups)

## Reading questions

During your reading or afterwards, answer the following questions. These will be graded on a scale of 0 to 1 on the basis of completeness and effort only. You should give a good-faith effort to answer each exercise and be right in your answer, but if you make a mathematical or conceptual mistake it will not count against you. However, if you leave an item blank, put “I don’t know”, or similarly do not put forth an effort to answer each question, you will lose credit. Be sure to come to class prepared to share your answers and to lead a discussion on these problems.
