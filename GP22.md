# Guided Practice 22: Investigation 30

## Preview

We continue to study group homomorphisms and the information that they give. We show how the kernel of a group homomorphism  can relate the structure of a group and its image under the homomorphism. 

## Reading

Read all of Investigation 29. 

## Learning Objectives 

The Concept Check quiz will be from objectives __CC.21__ and __CC.22__. Come prepared to do the following:

+ CC.21: State and instantiate the definitions of the following terms: Homomorphism of groups; epimorphism; monomorphism; homomorphic image; kernel of a homomorphism; image of a homomorphism
+ CC.22: State the following mathematical results: Theorem 30.4; Theorem 30.8; Theorem 30.13 (The First Isomorphism Theorem); Theorem 30.16 (The Second Isomorphism Theorem); Theorem 30.18 (The Third Isomorphism Theorem); Theorem 30.19 (The Fourth Isomorphism Theorem); Theorem 30.22
+ (CORE) M.24: Determine whether a function between two groups is a homomorphism (epimorphism, monomorphism). 
+ (CORE) M.25: Determine the kernel and image of a homomorphism. 

## Reading questions

During your reading or afterwards, answer the following questions. These will be graded on a scale of 0 to 1 on the basis of completeness and effort only. You should give a good-faith effort to answer each exercise and be right in your answer, but if you make a mathematical or conceptual mistake it will not count against you. However, if you leave an item blank, put “I don’t know”, or similarly do not put forth an effort to answer each question, you will lose credit. Be sure to come to class prepared to share your answers and to lead a discussion on these problems.
