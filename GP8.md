# Guided Practice 8: Investigation 23

## Preview

We learned about cyclic groups in the previous example. In this investigation we explore the types of subgroups that a cyclic group can have. We shall discover that the order of individual elements in a finite cyclic group must divide the order of the group.

## Learning Objectives 

There will be no Concept Check quiz in the next class. The new material will contain objective __CC.8__. Be sure that can do the following:

+ CC.8: State the following mathematical results: Theorem 23.2; Theorem 23.5; Theorem 23.6; Theorem 23.7; Theorem 23.10
+ M.7: Use Theorem 23.2 to determine information about subgroups of a cyclic group. 
+ (CORE) M.8: Use Theorem 23.5 to determine information about the order of an element in a cyclic group. 
+ (CORE) M.9: Determine subgroups of a given order in a cyclic group using Theorem 23.7. 


## Reading questions

During your reading or afterwards, answer the following questions. These will be graded on a scale of 0 to 1 on the basis of completeness and effort only. You should give a good-faith effort to answer each exercise and be right in your answer, but if you make a mathematical or conceptual mistake it will not count against you. However, if you leave an item blank, put “I don’t know”, or similarly do not put forth an effort to answer each question, you will lose credit. Be sure to come to class prepared to share your answers and to lead a discussion on these problems.
