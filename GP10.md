# Guided Practice 10: Investigation 25

## Preview

In this investigation we look at groups of permutations which we call symmetry groups. We will learn cycle notation which will allow us to break up a permutation into smaller parts. Permutation groups are important to group theory because every group is actually a subgroup of a group of permutations (as we shall see in Investigation 29). 
 
## Reading

Read all of Investigation 25. 

## Learning Objectives 

The Concept Check quiz will be from objective __CC.9__. The new material will contain objective __CC.10__ and __CC.11__. Be sure that can do the following:

+ CC.9: State and instantiate the definitions of the following terms: Dihedral group of order 2n; a subset that generates a group
+ M.10: Determine a presentation for a dihedral group. 
+ CC.10: State and instantiate the definitions of the following terms: ermutation; symmetric group of degree n; disjoint cycles; even and odd permutations; alternating group $A_n$
+ CC.11: State the following mathematical results: Theorem 25.4; Theorem 25.11; Theorem 25.14
+ CC.12: Write a permutation in cycle notation, and decompose a permutation into a product of disjoint cycles. 
+ M.11: Determine whether a permutation is even or odd. 

## Reading questions

During your reading or afterwards, answer the following questions. These will be graded on a scale of 0 to 1 on the basis of completeness and effort only. You should give a good-faith effort to answer each exercise and be right in your answer, but if you make a mathematical or conceptual mistake it will not count against you. However, if you leave an item blank, put “I don’t know”, or similarly do not put forth an effort to answer each question, you will lose credit. Be sure to come to class prepared to share your answers and to lead a discussion on these problems.
