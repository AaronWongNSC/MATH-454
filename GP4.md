# Guided Practice 4: Investigation 21

## Preview

In our new investigation we define integer exponentiation of group elements and show how individual elements can generate an entire group. Along the way we will show that the usual integer rules for exponents apply to all abelian groups.

## Learning Objectives 

The Concept Check quizzes will be drawn from objectives __CC.2__ and __CC.3__, while the new material will contain objectives __CC.4__ and __CC.5__. Be sure that can do the following:

+ CC.2: State and instantiate the definitions of the following terms: Group; Abelian group; finite/infinite order of a group; finite/infinite group; group of units in $\mathbb{Z}_n$
+ CC.3: State the following mathematical results: Theorem 20.7
+ M.2: Determine whether a set with a given binary operation is or is not a group. 
+ M.3: Given a group (especially the standard examples of groups from Activity 20.4), do the following: identify the identity element; identify the inverse of a given element; perform operations in the group; determine whether it is Abelian; determine its order. 
+ CC.4: State and instantiate the definitions of the following terms: Power of an element in a group
+ CC.5: State the following mathematical results: Theorem 21.4; Theorem 21.5
+ (CORE) M.4: Use properties of exponentiation to manipulate powers of group elements.


## Reading questions

During your reading or afterwards, answer the following questions. These will be graded on a scale of 0 to 1 on the basis of completeness and effort only. You should give a good-faith effort to answer each exercise and be right in your answer, but if you make a mathematical or conceptual mistake it will not count against you. However, if you leave an item blank, put “I don’t know”, or similarly do not put forth an effort to answer each question, you will lose credit. Be sure to come to class prepared to share your answers and to lead a discussion on these problems.
