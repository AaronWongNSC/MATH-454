# Guided Practice 18: Investigation 29

## Preview

We have seen that some groups have elements that look quite different from each other, though the underlying algebra turned out to coincide. In this investigation we learn about how two groups can be isomorphic (essentially the same) and how to prove it. Be sure to review the notions of __one-to-one__ and __onto__ so that you are prepared for lecture.

Read all of Investigation 29. 

## Learning Objectives 

The Concept Check quiz will be from objectives __CC.17__ and __CC.18__. The new material will cover __CC.19__ and __CC.20__. Be sure that can do the following:

+ CC.17: State and instantiate the definitions of the following terms: External direct product of two groups; internal direct product of two groups
+ CC.18: State the following mathematical results: Theorem 28.5; Theorem 28.6; Theorem 28.9; Theorem 28.15
+ (CORE) M.18: Determine the external direct product of two groups. 
+ M.19: Determine the order of an element in a direct product. 
+ CC.19; State and instantiate the definitions of the following terms: Isomorphism of groups; well-defined mapping
+ CC.20: State the following mathematical results: Theorem at the end of Activity 29.9; Theorem 29.14; Theorem 29.16; Theorem 29.18; Theorem 29.19; Theorem 29.24; Corollary 29.25 
+ (CORE) M.20: Determine whether a function between two groups is an isomorphism. 
+ (CORE) M.21: Show two groups are isomorphic by constructing an isomorphism between them. 
+ M.22: Determine whether a mapping is well-defined. 
+ (CORE) M.23: Show two groups are non-isomorphic by identifying differences on one or more invariants.

## Reading questions

During your reading or afterwards, answer the following questions. These will be graded on a scale of 0 to 1 on the basis of completeness and effort only. You should give a good-faith effort to answer each exercise and be right in your answer, but if you make a mathematical or conceptual mistake it will not count against you. However, if you leave an item blank, put “I don’t know”, or similarly do not put forth an effort to answer each question, you will lose credit. Be sure to come to class prepared to share your answers and to lead a discussion on these problems.
