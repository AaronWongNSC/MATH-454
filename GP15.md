# Guided Practice 15: Investigation 27

## Preview

We continue our investigation of normal subgroups and quotient groups. We introduce the notion of simple groups whihc are the fundamental building blocks of all groups. We then show that $A_n$ is a simple group. 
 
## Reading

Read all of Investigation 27. 

## Learning Objectives 

The Concept Check quiz will be from objectives  __CC.15__ and __CC.16__. Be sure that can do the following:

+ CC.15: State and instantiate the definitions of the following terms: The set G/H; normal subgroup; quotient group G/N; simple group
+ CC.16: State the following mathematical results: Theorem 27.5; Theorem 27.10; Theorem 27.11 (Cauchy's Theorem for Finite Abelian Groups)
+ (CORE) M.15: Determine the set G/H of distinct left cosets of H in G. 
+ (CORE) M.16: Determine whether a subgroup of a group is normal. 
+ (CORE) M.17: Determine the quotient group G/N of G by a normal subgroup N.


## Reading questions

During your reading or afterwards, answer the following questions. These will be graded on a scale of 0 to 1 on the basis of completeness and effort only. You should give a good-faith effort to answer each exercise and be right in your answer, but if you make a mathematical or conceptual mistake it will not count against you. However, if you leave an item blank, put “I don’t know”, or similarly do not put forth an effort to answer each question, you will lose credit. Be sure to come to class prepared to share your answers and to lead a discussion on these problems.
