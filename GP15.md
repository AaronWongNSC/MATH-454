# Guided Practice 15: Investigation 27

## Preview

We continue our investigation of normal subgroups and quotient groups. We introduce the notion of simple groups whihc are the fundamental building blocks of all groups. We then show that $A_n$ is a simple group. 
 
## Reading

Read all of Investigation 27. 

## Learning Objectives 

The Concept Check quiz will be from objectives  __CC.13__ and __CC.14__. Be sure that can do the following:

+ CC.13: State and instantiate the definitions of the following terms: The relation defined in Definition 26.3; left and right cosets of a subgroup; index of a subgroup
+ CC.14: State the following mathematical results: Theorem 26.7; Theorem 26.11 (Lagrange's Theorem); Corollary 26.13; Corollary 26.14
+ (CORE) M.12: Given a group G, a subgroup H, and an group element a, determine the left coset aH of H in G and the right coset Ha of H in G. 
+ (CORE) M.13: Use Lagrange's Theorem to determine information about the order of a subgroup of a group. 
+ (CORE) M.14: Use the Corollaries to Lagrange's Theorem to determine information about subgroups of a group and about powers of elements of a group. 


## Reading questions

During your reading or afterwards, answer the following questions. These will be graded on a scale of 0 to 1 on the basis of completeness and effort only. You should give a good-faith effort to answer each exercise and be right in your answer, but if you make a mathematical or conceptual mistake it will not count against you. However, if you leave an item blank, put “I don’t know”, or similarly do not put forth an effort to answer each question, you will lose credit. Be sure to come to class prepared to share your answers and to lead a discussion on these problems.
