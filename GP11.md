# Guided Practice 11: Investigation 25

## Preview

We carry on our investigation of symmetry groups. We will study the alternating group and the relationship between the dihedral groups and symmetry groups. We should take special care to make sure we are comfortable moving back and forth between cycle notation and permutation notation.
 
## Reading

Read all of Investigation 25. 

## Learning Objectives 

The Concept Check quiz will be from objectives __CC.10__, __CC.11__, and __CC.12__. Be sure that can do the following:

+ CC.10: State and instantiate the definitions of the following terms: ermutation; symmetric group of degree n; disjoint cycles; even and odd permutations; alternating group $A_n$
+ CC.11: State the following mathematical results: Theorem 25.4; Theorem 25.11; Theorem 25.14
+ CC.12: Write a permutation in cycle notation, and decompose a permutation into a product of disjoint cycles. 
+ M.11: Determine whether a permutation is even or odd. 

## Reading questions

During your reading or afterwards, answer the following questions. These will be graded on a scale of 0 to 1 on the basis of completeness and effort only. You should give a good-faith effort to answer each exercise and be right in your answer, but if you make a mathematical or conceptual mistake it will not count against you. However, if you leave an item blank, put “I don’t know”, or similarly do not put forth an effort to answer each question, you will lose credit. Be sure to come to class prepared to share your answers and to lead a discussion on these problems.

1. Complete exercises (1), (2), (3), and (4) from investigation 25.
