# Guided Practice 9: Investigation 24

## Preview

We return to studying the group of symmetries of a regular polygon. We give these groups the name __dihedral groups__. We introduce the notion of a group presentation and show that every symmetry is generated by a rotation and a reflection. We will spend only one day on this section. 
 
## Reading

Read all of Investigation 24. 

## Learning Objectives 

The Concept Check quiz will be from objective __CC.8__. The new material will contain objective __CC.9__. Be sure that can do the following:

+ CC.8: State the following mathematical results: Theorem 23.2; Theorem 23.5; Theorem 23.6; Theorem 23.7; Theorem 23.10
+ M.7: Use Theorem 23.2 to determine information about subgroups of a cyclic group. 
+ (CORE) M.8: Use Theorem 23.5 to determine information about the order of an element in a cyclic group. 
+ (CORE) M.9: Determine subgroups of a given order in a cyclic group using Theorem 23.7. 
+ CC.9: State and instantiate the definitions of the following terms: Dihedral group of order 2n; a subset that generates a group
+ M.10: Determine a presentation for a dihedral group. 


## Reading questions

During your reading or afterwards, answer the following questions. These will be graded on a scale of 0 to 1 on the basis of completeness and effort only. You should give a good-faith effort to answer each exercise and be right in your answer, but if you make a mathematical or conceptual mistake it will not count against you. However, if you leave an item blank, put “I don’t know”, or similarly do not put forth an effort to answer each question, you will lose credit. Be sure to come to class prepared to share your answers and to lead a discussion on these problems.
