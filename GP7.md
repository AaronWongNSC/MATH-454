# Guided Practice 7: Review

## Preview

The next class period is a review. Go over all of the material from Investigations 19-22. 
 
## Reading

Re-read your notes. Try to anticipate the exam questions.

## Learning Objectives 

The 6 exam questions will cover the objectives below.

+ (CORE) M.1: Create or complete an operation table for symmetries of a figure. 
+ (CORE) M.2: Determine whether a set with a given binary operation is or is not a group. 
+ (CORE) M.3: Given a group (especially the standard examples of groups on page 285), do the following: identify the identity element; identify the inverse of a given element; perform operations in the group; determine whether it is Abelian; determine its order. 
+ (CORE) M.4: Use properties of exponentiation to manipulate powers of group elements.
+ (CORE) M.5: Determine whether a subset of a group is a subgroup of that group by applying the Subgroup Test.
+ (CORE) M.6: Determine the subgroup of a group that is generated by a single element $a$ (that is, the cyclic subgroup generated by $a$).

## Reading questions

During your reading or afterwards, answer the following questions. These will be graded on a scale of 0 to 1 on the basis of completeness and effort only. You should give a good-faith effort to answer each exercise and be right in your answer, but if you make a mathematical or conceptual mistake it will not count against you. However, if you leave an item blank, put “I don’t know”, or similarly do not put forth an effort to answer each question, you will lose credit. Be sure to come to class prepared to share your answers and to lead a discussion on these problems.

1. Find all subgroups of $D_4$ (the group of symmetries of a square). What is the center of $D_4$?
