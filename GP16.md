# Guided Practice 16: Investigation 28

## Preview

Two groups can be used to create a new group which we shall call the direct product. t semester we saw the direct product of rings whose additive structure was an abelian group. We will try to discover the algebraic structure of direct products and ty to see which groups "secretly" have the structure of a direct product already.

## Learning Objectives 

The Concept Check quiz will be from objectives  __CC.15__ and __CC.16__. The new material will cover __CC.17__ and __CC.18__ Be sure that can do the following:

+ CC.15: State and instantiate the definitions of the following terms: The set G/H; normal subgroup; quotient group G/N; simple group
+ CC.16: State the following mathematical results: Theorem 27.5; Theorem 27.10; Theorem 27.11 (Cauchy's Theorem for Finite Abelian Groups)
+ (CORE) M.15: Determine the set G/H of distinct left cosets of H in G. 
+ (CORE) M.16: Determine whether a subgroup of a group is normal. 
+ (CORE) M.17: Determine the quotient group G/N of G by a normal subgroup N.
+ CC.17: State and instantiate the definitions of the following terms: External direct product of two groups; internal direct product of two groups
+ CC.18: State the following mathematical results: Theorem 28.5; Theorem 28.6; Theorem 28.9; Theorem 28.15
+ (CORE) M.18: Determine the external direct product of two groups. 
+ M.19: Determine the order of an element in a direct product. 


## Reading questions

During your reading or afterwards, answer the following questions. These will be graded on a scale of 0 to 1 on the basis of completeness and effort only. You should give a good-faith effort to answer each exercise and be right in your answer, but if you make a mathematical or conceptual mistake it will not count against you. However, if you leave an item blank, put “I don’t know”, or similarly do not put forth an effort to answer each question, you will lose credit. Be sure to come to class prepared to share your answers and to lead a discussion on these problems.
