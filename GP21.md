# Guided Practice 21: Investigation 30

## Preview

We saw previously that group isomorphisms preserve the structure of the groups involved. Here we look at functions that preserve structure but might not be one-to-one or onto. We call these functions homomorphisms. We will find an interesting connection between groups homomorphisms and quotient groups.

## Learning Objectives 

The Concept Check quiz will be from objectives  __CC.19__ and __CC.20__. The new material will come from objectives __CC.21__ and __CC.22__. Come prepared to do the following:

+ CC.19; State and instantiate the definitions of the following terms: Isomorphism of groups; well-defined mapping
+ CC.20: State the following mathematical results: Theorem at the end of Activity 29.9; Theorem 29.14; Theorem 29.16; Theorem 29.18; Theorem 29.19; Theorem 29.24; Corollary 29.25 
+ (CORE) M.20: Determine whether a function between two groups is an isomorphism. 
+ (CORE) M.21: Show two groups are isomorphic by constructing an isomorphism between them. 
+ M.22: Determine whether a mapping is well-defined. 
+ (CORE) M.23: Show two groups are non-isomorphic by identifying differences on one or more invariants.
+ CC.21: State and instantiate the definitions of the following terms: Homomorphism of groups; epimorphism; monomorphism; homomorphic image; kernel of a homomorphism; image of a homomorphism
+ CC.22: State the following mathematical results: Theorem 30.4; Theorem 30.8; Theorem 30.13 (The First Isomorphism Theorem); Theorem 30.16 (The Second Isomorphism Theorem); Theorem 30.18 (The Third Isomorphism Theorem); Theorem 30.19 (The Fourth Isomorphism Theorem); Theorem 30.22
+ (CORE) M.24: Determine whether a function between two groups is a homomorphism (epimorphism, monomorphism). 
+ (CORE) M.25: Determine the kernel and image of a homomorphism. 

## Reading questions

During your reading or afterwards, answer the following questions. These will be graded on a scale of 0 to 1 on the basis of completeness and effort only. You should give a good-faith effort to answer each exercise and be right in your answer, but if you make a mathematical or conceptual mistake it will not count against you. However, if you leave an item blank, put “I don’t know”, or similarly do not put forth an effort to answer each question, you will lose credit. Be sure to come to class prepared to share your answers and to lead a discussion on these problems.
