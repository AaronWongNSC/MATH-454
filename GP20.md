Reread all of Investigations 27, 28, and 29. 

## Learning Objectives 

The learning objectives on the test are the following.

+ (CORE) M.15: Determine the set G/H of distinct left cosets of H in G. 
+ (CORE) M.16: Determine whether a subgroup of a group is normal. 
+ (CORE) M.17: Determine the quotient group G/N of G by a normal subgroup N.
+ (CORE) M.18: Determine the external direct product of two groups. 
+ (CORE) M.20: Determine whether a function between two groups is an isomorphism. 
+ (CORE) M.21: Show two groups are isomorphic by constructing an isomorphism between them. 
+ (CORE) M.23: Show two groups are non-isomorphic by identifying differences on one or more invariants. 

## Reading questions

During your reading or afterwards, answer the following questions. These will be graded on a scale of 0 to 1 on the basis of completeness and effort only. You should give a good-faith effort to answer each exercise and be right in your answer, but if you make a mathematical or conceptual mistake it will not count against you. However, if you leave an item blank, put “I don’t know”, or similarly do not put forth an effort to answer each question, you will lose credit. Be sure to come to class prepared to share your answers and to lead a discussion on these problems.

1. Identify five different groups with elements of order 8.
