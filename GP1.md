# Guided Practice 1: Investigation 19

## Preview

We begin our study in Math 454 with a phenomenon that occurs with great frequency in everyday life, namely the _symmetry_ of objects. We all have an idea of what symmetry means, but you may not realize that symmetries of an object possess some interesting patterns and forms that are worth studying mathematically. In this investigation, we'll classify the symmetries of regular polygons and other simple figures and think about their _composition_; and finally notice that the set of symmetries of an object, together with composition of symmetries thought of as a binary operation, form a certain self-contained system that we can study mathematically. 
We will be following up on our introduction to the properties of the integers by discussing the axioms for ordering and working on proof validation and proof-writing activities that involve both the arithmetic and ordering axioms. We will begin with an Concept Check Quiz (see objectives below). 

## Reading

In the Hodge/Schlicker/Sundstrom text, read all of Investigation 19. Note that about half of this was already covered in class on Tuesday, but there are portions of that material that we did not stress, so you should still read the material in the book. You do NOT have to work the “Activities” in the book unless you want to, because we will be working on these in class.

## Learning Objectives 

The following are basic tasks that you should be familiar with when you come to class. We will not re-teach these in class, although after the Concept Check quiz we will have time for questions and answers on them. The Concept Check quiz will be drawn from objectives __CC.1__. Be sure that can do the following:

+ State and instantiate the definitions of the following terms: Rigid motion; symmetry.
+ Create or complete an operation table for symmetries of a figure.

## Reading questions

During your reading or afterwards, answer the following questions. These will be graded on a scale of 0 to 1 on the basis of completeness and effort only. You should give a good-faith effort to answer each exercise and be right in your answer, but if you make a mathematical or conceptual mistake it will not count against you. However, if you leave an item blank, put “I don’t know”, or similarly do not put forth an effort to answer each question, you will lose credit. Be sure to come to class prepared to share your answers and to lead a discussion on these problems.

1. Work through Preview Activity 19.1 on page 271, which asks you to identify all the ways in which the figure (a four-leaved rose) is symmetric and to describe those symmetries. Example: One symmetry of that figure is a 90-degree counterclockwise rotation. Another would be reflection in a line that goes between two of the leaves. (If you have a hard time seeing these, create a cut-out of the rose leaf and physically manipulate it instead.)
2. Starting on page 273, there is a discussion about writing symmetries of a regular octagon in 2x8 matrix that shows where each vertex is mapped under a symmetry. The book shows the matrices for four different symmetries of the regular octagon, but there are several symmetries that are not shown. For example, another symmetry of the regular octagon is a 90 degree counterclockwise rotation about the center. In your notes, write down the matrix notation for that particular symmetry.  On the submission form, write down the _second row_ of the matrix you come up with. 
3. Now compose the symmetry you came up with in the previous question (90-degree rotation counterclockwise about the origin) with $r_V$, the reflection about the vertical axis -- _in that order_, with the rotation coming first and the reflection second -- and write the result in matrix format. In your notes, write down the matrix notation for that particular symmetry.  On the submission form, write down the _second row_ of the matrix you come up with.
4. Does the order of composition matter in the previous question? Explain.
