# Guided Practice 17: Investigation 28

## Preview

We examine the notion of internal direct product vs external direct product. We also investigate normal subgroups and quotient groups of direct products. We learn how to find the order of elements of a direct product. 
 
## Reading

Read all of Investigation 28. 

## Learning Objectives 

The Concept Check quiz will be from objectives __CC.17__ and __CC.18__. Be sure that can do the following:

+ CC.17: State and instantiate the definitions of the following terms: External direct product of two groups; internal direct product of two groups
+ CC.18: State the following mathematical results: Theorem 28.5; Theorem 28.6; Theorem 28.9; Theorem 28.15
+ (CORE) M.18: Determine the external direct product of two groups. 
+ M.19: Determine the order of an element in a direct product. 


## Reading questions

During your reading or afterwards, answer the following questions. These will be graded on a scale of 0 to 1 on the basis of completeness and effort only. You should give a good-faith effort to answer each exercise and be right in your answer, but if you make a mathematical or conceptual mistake it will not count against you. However, if you leave an item blank, put “I don’t know”, or similarly do not put forth an effort to answer each question, you will lose credit. Be sure to come to class prepared to share your answers and to lead a discussion on these problems.

1. Complete Exercise (1) from Activity 28.
