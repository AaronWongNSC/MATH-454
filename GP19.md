# Guided Practice 19: Investigation 29

## Preview

We continue on with our study of group isomorphisms. Isomorphisms allow us to gain understanding of one group by studying another group. We will show that every group is a subgroup of a permutation group (Cayley's Theorem), which will explain why we focused so much on studying permutation groups.

## Learning Objectives 

The Concept Check quiz will be from objectives  __CC.19__ and __CC.20__. Come prepared to do the following:

+ CC.19; State and instantiate the definitions of the following terms: Isomorphism of groups; well-defined mapping
+ CC.20: State the following mathematical results: Theorem at the end of Activity 29.9; Theorem 29.14; Theorem 29.16; Theorem 29.18; Theorem 29.19; Theorem 29.24; Corollary 29.25 
+ (CORE) M.20: Determine whether a function between two groups is an isomorphism. 
+ (CORE) M.21: Show two groups are isomorphic by constructing an isomorphism between them. 
+ M.22: Determine whether a mapping is well-defined. 
+ (CORE) M.23: Show two groups are non-isomorphic by identifying differences on one or more invariants.

## Reading questions

During your reading or afterwards, answer the following questions. These will be graded on a scale of 0 to 1 on the basis of completeness and effort only. You should give a good-faith effort to answer each exercise and be right in your answer, but if you make a mathematical or conceptual mistake it will not count against you. However, if you leave an item blank, put “I don’t know”, or similarly do not put forth an effort to answer each question, you will lose credit. Be sure to come to class prepared to share your answers and to lead a discussion on these problems.
