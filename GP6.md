# Guided Practice 6: Investigation 22

## Preview

We continue our investigation of subgroups. We cover cyclic subgroups and the center of a group. 
 
## Reading

Read all of Investigation 22. 

## Learning Objectives 

The Concept Check quizzes will be drawn from objectives __CC.6__ and __CC.7__. Be sure that can do the following:

+ CC.6: State and instantiate the definitions of the following terms: Subgroup; center of a group; cyclic subgroup generated by an element; cyclic group; order of an element in a group
+ CC.7: State the following mathematical results: Theorem 22.4 (Subgroup Test)
+ (CORE) M.5: Determine whether a subset of a group is a subgroup of that group by applying the Subgroup Test.
+ (CORE) M.6: Determine the subgroup of a group that is generated by a single element $a$ (that is, the cyclic subgroup generated by $a$).


## Reading questions

During your reading or afterwards, answer the following questions. These will be graded on a scale of 0 to 1 on the basis of completeness and effort only. You should give a good-faith effort to answer each exercise and be right in your answer, but if you make a mathematical or conceptual mistake it will not count against you. However, if you leave an item blank, put “I don’t know”, or similarly do not put forth an effort to answer each question, you will lose credit. Be sure to come to class prepared to share your answers and to lead a discussion on these problems.
