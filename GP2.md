# Guided Practice 2: Investigation 20

## Preview

In Investigation 19, we learned that the set of symmetries of an object, together with the binary operation of composition of symmetries, forms a self-contained algebraic system that obeys certain rules. In this Investigation, we build off of this to define the concept of a _group_, which gives structure to _any_ set of objects with a binary operation that behave similarly. Groups are the central object of study in this course, so this is a very important Investigation. We will begin by examining other sets with binary operations -- some of which are very familiar -- that obey the same rules as the set of symmetries with composition and use the properties they have in common to give a formal definition of a group.

## Learning Objectives 

The following are basic tasks that you should be familiar with when you come to class. We will not re-teach these in class, although after the Concept Check quiz we will have time for questions and answers on them. The Concept Check quizzes will be drawn from objectives __CC.2__ and __CC.3__. Be sure that can do the following:

+ CC.2: State and instantiate the definitions of the following terms: Group; Abelian group; finite/infinite order of a group; finite/infinite group; unit
+ CC.3: State the following mathematical results: Theorem 20.7
+ M.2: Determine whether a set with a given binary operation is or is not a group. 
+ M.3: Given a group (especially the standard examples of groups from Activity 20.4), do the following: identify the identity element; identify the inverse of a given element; perform operations in the group; determine whether it is Abelian; determine its order; and describe its group of units. 

## Reading questions

During your reading or afterwards, answer the following questions. These will be graded on a scale of 0 to 1 on the basis of completeness and effort only. You should give a good-faith effort to answer each exercise and be right in your answer, but if you make a mathematical or conceptual mistake it will not count against you. However, if you leave an item blank, put “I don’t know”, or similarly do not put forth an effort to answer each question, you will lose credit. Be sure to come to class prepared to share your answers and to lead a discussion on these problems.

1. For each of the sets and operations in Preview Activity 20.1 determine whether each statement below is accurate. (No detailed proofs are necessary.)
 1. The set is closed under the operation.
 2. The operation is associative.
 3. The set contains an identity element.
 4. The set contains an inverse for each element.
 5. The operation is commutative.
