# Guided Practice 2: Investigation 20

## Preview

We will continue our study of groups and their basic properties. You should be collecting examples of groups that you can call upon in the future.  
 
## Reading

Read all of Investigation 20. 

## Learning Objectives 

The following are basic tasks that you should be familiar with when you come to class. We will not re-teach these in class, although after the Concept Check quiz we will have time for questions and answers on them. The Concept Check quizzes will be drawn from objectives __CC.2__ and __CC.3__. Be sure that can do the following:

+ CC.2: State and instantiate the definitions of the following terms: Group; Abelian group; finite/infinite order of a group; finite/infinite group; unit
+ CC.3: State the following mathematical results: Theorem 20.7
+ M.2: Determine whether a set with a given binary operation is or is not a group. 
+ M.3: Given a group (especially the standard examples of groups from Activity 20.4), do the following: identify the identity element; identify the inverse of a given element; perform operations in the group; determine whether it is Abelian; determine its order; and describe its group of units. 

## Reading questions

During your reading or afterwards, answer the following questions. These will be graded on a scale of 0 to 1 on the basis of completeness and effort only. You should give a good-faith effort to answer each exercise and be right in your answer, but if you make a mathematical or conceptual mistake it will not count against you. However, if you leave an item blank, put “I don’t know”, or similarly do not put forth an effort to answer each question, you will lose credit. Be sure to come to class prepared to share your answers and to lead a discussion on these problems.
